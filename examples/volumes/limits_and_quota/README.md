# Limiting storage resource consumption

## Background

This document shows how an administrator can limit storage resource consumption in the cluster. Familiarity with
PersistentVolumes (PVs), PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), LimitRanges, and StorageQuotas is assumed.

## Use cases

1. Ability to enforce min/max storage requests for persistent volume claims
2. Ability to limit the amount of storage given per namespace

## LimitRange to limit requests for storage

Adding a `LimitRange` to a namespace enforces storage request sizes to a minimum and maximum. Storage is requested
via `PersistentVolumeClaim`. The admission controller that enforces limit ranges will reject any PVC that is above or below
the values set by the admin.

In this example, a PVC requesting 10Gi of storage would be rejected because it exceeds the 2Gi max.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: storagelimits
spec:
  limits:
  - type: PersistentVolumeClaim
    max:
      storage: 2Gi
    min:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## StorageQuota to PVC count and cumulative storage capacity

Admins can limit the number of PVCs in a namespace as well as the cumulative capacity of those PVCs. New PVCs that exceed
either maximum value will be rejected.

In this example, a 6th PVC in the namespace would be rejected because it exceeds the maximum count of 5. Alternatively, 
a 5Gi maximum quota when combined with the 2Gi max limit above, cannot have 3 PVCs where each has 2Gi. That would be 6Gi requested
 for a namespace capped at 5Gi. 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: storagequota
spec:
  hard:
    persistentvolumeclaims: "5"
    requests.storage: "5Gi"
```
