reflects services as defined in the Kubernetes API on each node and can do simple
TCP,UDP stream forwarding or round robin TCP,UDP forwarding across a set of backends.
Service cluster ips and ports are currently found through Docker-links-compatible
environment variables specifying ports opened by the service proxy. There is an optional
addon that provides cluster DNS for these cluster IPs. The user must create a service
with the apiserver API to configure the proxy.
