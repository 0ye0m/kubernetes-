# Generate OpenAPI definitions

- To generate definition for a specific type or package add "+k8s:openapi-gen=true" tag to the type/package comment lines.
- To exclude a type or a member from a tagged package/type, add "+k8s:openapi-gen=false" tag to the comment lines.

# OpenAPI Extensions
OpenAPI spec can have extension on types. To define one or more extension on a type or its member
add "+k8s:openapi-gen=x-kubernetes-$NAME:$VALUE" to the comment lines before type/member. A type/member can
have multiple extensions. The rest of the line in the comment will be used as $VALUE so there is no need to
escape or quote the value string.
