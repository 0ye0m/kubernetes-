.SH NAME
.PP
kube\-controller\-manager \- kube\-controller\-manager is the daemon running most of the systems control loops


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkube\-controller\-manager\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Kubernetes controller manager is a daemon that embeds
the core control loops shipped with Kubernetes. In applications of robotics and
automation, a control loop is a non\-terminating loop that regulates the state of
the system. In Kubernetes, a controller is a control loop that watches the shared
state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the
current state towards the desired state. Examples of controllers that ship with
Kubernetes today are the replication controller, endpoints controller, namespace
controller, and serviceaccounts controller.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-address\fP=127.0.0.1
    The IP address to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)

.PP
\fB\-\-allocate\-node\-cidrs\fP[=false]
    Should CIDRs for Pods be allocated and set on the cloud provider.

.PP
\fB\-\-alsologtostderr\fP[=false]
    log to standard error as well as files

.PP
\fB\-\-cloud\-config\fP=""
    The path to the cloud provider configuration file.  Empty string for no configuration file.

.PP
\fB\-\-cloud\-provider\fP=""
    The provider for cloud services.  Empty string for no provider.

.PP
\fB\-\-cluster\-cidr\fP=<nil>
    CIDR Range for Pods in cluster.

.PP
\fB\-\-cluster\-name\fP="kubernetes"
    The instance prefix for the cluster

.PP
\fB\-\-concurrent\-endpoint\-syncs\fP=5
    The number of endpoint syncing operations that will be done concurrently. Larger number = faster endpoint updating, but more CPU (and network) load

.PP
\fB\-\-concurrent\-rc\-syncs\fP=5
    The number of replication controllers that are allowed to sync concurrently. Larger number = more reponsive replica management, but more CPU (and network) load

.PP
\fB\-\-deleting\-pods\-burst\fP=10
    Number of nodes on which pods are bursty deleted in case of node failure. For more details look into RateLimiter.

.PP
\fB\-\-deleting\-pods\-qps\fP=0.1
    Number of nodes per second on which pods are deleted in case of node failure.

.PP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP[=false]
    help for kube\-controller\-manager

.PP
\fB\-\-httptest.serve\fP=""
    if non\-empty, httptest.NewServer serves on this address and blocks

.PP
\fB\-\-kubeconfig\fP=""
    Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information.

.PP
\fB\-\-log\-backtrace\-at\fP=:0
    when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace

.PP
\fB\-\-log\-dir\fP=""
    If non\-empty, write log files in this directory

.PP
\fB\-\-log\-flush\-frequency\fP=5s
    Maximum number of seconds between log flushes

.PP
\fB\-\-logtostderr\fP[=true]
    log to standard error instead of files

.PP
\fB\-\-master\fP=""
    The address of the Kubernetes API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig)

.PP
\fB\-\-namespace\-sync\-period\fP=5m0s
    The period for syncing namespace life\-cycle updates

.PP
\fB\-\-node\-monitor\-grace\-period\fP=40s
    Amount of time which we allow running Node to be unresponsive before marking it unhealty. Must be N times more than kubelet's nodeStatusUpdateFrequency, where N means number of retries allowed for kubelet to post node status.

.PP
\fB\-\-node\-monitor\-period\fP=5s
    The period for syncing NodeStatus in NodeController.

.PP
\fB\-\-node\-startup\-grace\-period\fP=1m0s
    Amount of time which we allow starting Node to be unresponsive before marking it unhealty.

.PP
\fB\-\-node\-sync\-period\fP=10s
    The period for syncing nodes from cloudprovider. Longer periods will result in fewer calls to cloud provider, but may delay addition of new nodes to cluster.

.PP
\fB\-\-pod\-eviction\-timeout\fP=5m0s
    The grace period for deleting pods on failed nodes.

.PP
\fB\-\-port\fP=10252
    The port that the controller\-manager's http service runs on

.PP
\fB\-\-profiling\fP[=true]
    Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/

.PP
\fB\-\-pvclaimbinder\-sync\-period\fP=10s
    The period for syncing persistent volumes and persistent volume claims

.PP
\fB\-\-resource\-quota\-sync\-period\fP=10s
    The period for syncing quota usage status in the system

.PP
\fB\-\-root\-ca\-file\fP=""
    If set, this root certificate authority will be included in service account's token secret. This must be a valid PEM\-encoded CA bundle.

.PP
\fB\-\-service\-account\-private\-key\-file\fP=""
    Filename containing a PEM\-encoded private RSA key used to sign service account tokens.

.PP
\fB\-\-service\-sync\-period\fP=5m0s
    The period for syncing services with their external load balancers

.PP
\fB\-\-stderrthreshold\fP=2
    logs at or above this threshold go to stderr

.PP
\fB\-\-v\fP=0
    log level for V logs

.PP
\fB\-\-version\fP=false
    Print version information and quit

.PP
\fB\-\-vmodule\fP=
    comma\-separated list of pattern=N settings for file\-filtered logging
