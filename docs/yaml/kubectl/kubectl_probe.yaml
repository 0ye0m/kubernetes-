  Set or remove a liveness or readiness probe from a pod or pod template

  Each container in a pod may define one or more probes that are used for general health
  checking. A liveness probe is checked periodically to ensure the container is still healthy:
  if the probe fails, the container is restarted. Readiness probes set or clear the ready
  flag for each container, which controls whether the container's ports are included in the list
  of endpoints for a service and whether a deployment can proceed. A readiness check should
  indicate when your container is ready to accept incoming traffic or begin handling work.
  Setting both liveness and readiness probes for each container is highly recommended.

  The three probe types are:

  1. Open a TCP socket on the pod IP
  2. Perform an HTTP GET against a URL on a container that must return 200 OK
  3. Run a command in the container that must return exit code 0

  Containers that take a variable amount of time to start should set generous
  initial-delay-seconds values, otherwise as your application evolves you may suddenly begin
  to fail.

example: |2-
    # Clear both readiness and liveness probes off all containers
    kubectl probe dc/registry --remove --readiness --liveness

    # Set an exec action as a liveness probe to run 'echo ok'
    kubectl probe dc/registry --liveness -- echo ok

    # Set a readiness probe to try to open a TCP socket on 3306
    kubectl probe rc/mysql --readiness --open-tcp=3306

    # Set an HTTP readiness probe for port 8080 and path /healthz over HTTP on the pod IP
    kubectl probe dc/webapp --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/healthz

    # Set an HTTP readiness probe over HTTPS on 127.0.0.1 for a hostNetwork pod
    kubectl probe dc/router --readiness --get-url=https://127.0.0.1:1936/stats
