# Flex Volume API Proposal
## Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to extend and enhance the existing flex volume storage plugin model (#13840). It bridges the gap with existing in-tree plugins and defines a stable api.

## Background:
The existing flex volume plugin enables administrators/vendors to create out-of-tree volume plugins, i.e., plugins which do not reside in Kubernetes project. But, it has the following gaps:
* It lacks support for the latest enhancements to in-tree plugins like dynamic provisioning and centralized attach-detach controller
* It does not define a stable driver api for administrators/vendors to work with.
* The current flex volume plugin deployment model is not suitable for environments like GCE & CoreOS, where access to the root file system is restricted. And in other environments the overall user experience is poor, as it requires manual installation of the plugin on every node and restart of kubelets & controller manager. This issue is covered in detail in another PR #32550.

### Goals:
The goals of this proposal are 
* Define new stable driver API.
* Add support for dynamic provisioning and centralized attach-detach controller and
* The biggest advantage of flex volume is itâ€™s simplicity. It is just an adapter around the internal api. We will keep it simple in the new design and try to follow the same adapter pattern.

### Non Goals:
* This proposal does not the address the poor installation model of existing model. It is covered in another PR #32550.

## Terminology:
**Plugin**: refers to flex volume plugin.

**Plugin Driver API**: API calls defined by flex volume plugin.

**Plugin Driver**: Out-of-tree driver/plugin which implements plugin driver api.

**In-tree plugin**: Plugins which are included in Kubernetes project/source tree.

## API:
Existing flex volume plugin driver api is in alpha phase and are subject to change between Kubernetes versions. This section proposes stable api for plugin driver writers to work with.

### Proposal:
Proposes fewer APIs with stable request & response API objects.

###### Pros:
* Has standard request & response API objects.
* Supports versioning.
* Uses gRPC.
* Fewer calls.
* Simple and clean interface.

###### Cons:
* New API objects.

### Other options considered:
Expose the existing in-tree plugin API as driver API. For more details on existing in-tree plugin API please refer to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/volume.go

###### Pros:
* In-tree plugins are already using these API.
* Simple and clean interface.

###### Cons:
* No standard request & response API objects.
* No versioning support.
* Does not follow REST model.
* Many call outs. For full support, a plugin has to implement 17 APIs.

## Dynamic Provisioning support:
Dynamic provisioning support is optional. Driver can choose to implement it by implementing Create & Delete APIs. Driver should also report it supports dynamic provisioning by setting the "supports_dynamic_provisioning" capability.

## Attach detach support:
Attach detach support is optional. Driver can choose to implement it by implementing Attach & Detach APIs. Driver should also report the type of attachment policy it supports. If the driver supports attach from Kubelet it should report AttachmentPolicy "LOCAL" and if it supports attaching from Central controller(controller-manager), it should report AttachmentPolicy "GLOBAL".

PR by @MikaelCluseau (#26926) would be leveraged for this change.
