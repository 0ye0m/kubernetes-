## Cluster Federation (a.k.a. "Ubernetes")
A high level RFC regarding federation of Kubernetes clusters is
[available as a Google Doc for comment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14amQSNJBlcsWPozQTE5R19sMJZ1ePmFJT0AYcrNBMf8/edit#)
If you're a member of
[kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-dev)
you already have read and comment rights on the doc.  If not, either
join that group, or or email me, quinton@google.com your gmail address, and I'll grant you access.

The main feedback I'm looking for is whether any important classes of
use cases have been overlooked, and whether the proposed behaviour and
implementation (as vague as it still is) is problematic.
