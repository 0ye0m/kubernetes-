# Super Simple Discovery API

## Overview

It is surprisingly hard to figure out how to talk to a Kubernetes cluster.  Not only do client need to know where to look on the network, they also need to identify the set of root certificates to trust when talking to that endpoint.  

This presents a set of problems:
* It should be super easy for users to configure client systems with a minimum of effort `kubectl` or `kubeadm init` (or other client systems).
  * Establishing this should be doable even in the face of nodes and master components booting out of order.
  * We should have mechanisms that don't require users to ever have to manually manage certificate files.
* Over the life of the cluster this information could change and client systems should be able to adapt.

## ClusterInfo object

First we define a set of information that identifies a cluster and how to talk to it.  

This includes:

* A cluster serial number/identifier.  
  * In an HA world, API servers may come and go and it is necessary to make sure we are talking to the same cluster as we thought we were talking to.
  * It looks like Federation already has this concept.  We need to back port that to non-federated clusters.
* A set of addresses for finding the cluster.  
  * It is implied that all of these are equivalent and that a client can try multiple until an appropriate target is found.
  * Initially I’m proposing a flat set here.  In the future we can introduce more structure that hints to the user which addresses to try first.
* A set of root certificates to trust for this cluster.
  * We make this a set so that root certificates can be rotated.
  * These are BASE64 encoded PEM values (without `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` lines).
  This is similar to how [JWS encodes certifcates in JSON](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515%23appendix-B&sa=D&ust=1471374807953000&usg=AFQjCNFQNcmbquq3XEegKc76v5j956aSPw).
* The date and time this information was fetched.
  * This is so that a client can figure out if this information is out of date.
  * Perhaps include a TTL?

  Any client of the cluster will want to have this information.  As the configuration of the cluster changes we need the client to keep this information up to date.  It is assumed that the information here won’t drift so fast that clients won’t be able to find *some* way to connect.

  In exceptional circumstances, it is possible that this information may be out of date and a client would be unable to connect to a cluster.  If a user has kubectl set up and working well pointing to raw IP addresses and doesn’t run it for a long time it is possible that both (a) the set of servers will have migrated so that no IP is good or (b) the root certificates will have rotated so that the user can no longer trust the endpoint.

  We serialize this into a JSON object (exact syntax still TBD -- this is a sketch).  The whitespace is inserted for readability.

**TODO/Questions**:
  * Turn this into a real Kubernetes API object with standard structure
  * Do we need to handle more complicated structure for specifying endpoints? Perhaps a priority?
  * Does this get versioned with the rest of the API or is it a separate thing?
  * How do we say "trust system installed roots"?  It is possible users will configure the cluster with a publicly signed certificate.

## Methods

Now that we know *what* we want to get to the client, the question is how.  We want to do this in as secure a way possible (as there are cryptographic keys involved) without requiring a lot of overhead in terms of information that needs to be copied around.

### Method: Out of Band

The simplest way to do this would be to simply put this object in a file and copy it around.  This is more overhead for the user, but it is easy to implement and lets users rely on existing systems to distribute configuration.

For the (currently being designed) `kubeadm` flow, the command line might look like:

```
kubeadm join --cluster-info-file=my-cluster.json
```

Note that TLS bootstrap (which establishes a way for a client to authenticate itself to the server) is a separate issue and has its own set of methods.  This command line may have a TLS bootstrap token (or config file) on the command line also.

### Method: HTTPS endpoint

If the ClusterInfo information is hosted in a trusted place of HTTPS you can just request it that way.  This will use the root certificates that are installed on the system.  It may or may not be appropriate based on the user's constraints.

```
kubeadm join --cluster-info-url="https://example/mycluster.json"
```

This is really a shorthand for someone doing something like (assuming we support stdin with `-`):

```
curl https://example.com/mycluster.json | kubeadm join --cluster-info-file=-
```

If the user requires some auth to the HTTPS server (to keep the ClusterInfo object private) that can be done in the curl command equivalent.  Or we could eventually add it to `kubeadm` directly.

### Method: JWS Token

There won’t always be a trusted external endpoint to talk to and transmitting the locator file out of band is a pain.  However, we want something a bit more secure than just hitting HTTP and trusting whatever we get back.  In this case, we assume we have the following:
  * An address for at least one of the API servers (which will implement this API).
    * This address is technically an HTTPS URL base but is often expressed as a bare domain or IP.
  * A shared secret token

An interesting aspect here is that this information is often easily obtained before the API server is configured or started.  This makes some cluster bring-up scenarios much easier.

We put some structure into the token.  It has both a token identifier and the token value, separated by a dot.  Example:

```
A81E5d4DwI.0ok9tB1QhB
```

The first part of the token is the `token-id`.  The second part is the `token-secret`.

The user experience for joining a cluster would be something like:

```
kubeadm join --token=A81E5d4DwI.0ok9tB1QhB <address>
```

**Note:** This is logically a different use of the token from TLS bootstrap.  We should look to harmonize these usages and allow the same token to play double duty.  It is likely that the bare `--token` command line flag will indicate the token be used for both ClusterInfo and TLS bootstrap.

#### Quick Primer on JWS
[JSON Web Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) are a way to sign, serialize and verify a payload.  It supports both symmetric keys (aka shared secrets) along with asymmetric keys (aka public key infrastructure or key pairs).  The JWS is split in to 3 parts:
1. a header about how it is signed
2. the clear text payload
3. the signature.  

There are a couple of different ways of encoding this data -- either as a JSON object or as a set of BASE64URL strings for including in headers or URL parameters.  In this case, we are using a shared secret and the HMAC-SHA256 signing algorithm and encoding it as a JSON object.  The popular JWT (JSON Web Tokens) specification is a type of JWS.

#### ClusterInfo Request

The API server serves up a simple plain old HTTP endpoint for this.  The client does a HTTP GET to:

```
http://<address>/cluster-info/v1/?token-id=<token-id>
```

#### ClusterInfo Response

The server will look up the appropriate shared secret based on the token id.  If the server doesn't know about the token specified or there is no token specified it MUST respond with an HTTP 403 forbidden error.

If it does recognize the token it will respond with a JWS object using the flattened JWS JSON serialization syntax (JWS section 7.2.2).

The `Content-Type` header of the response MUST be `application/jose+json`. The `kid` (key id) header value MUST be the `token-id`. The `alg` MUST be `HS256` (HMAC-SHA256).

The full JWS will look something like:

```json

  "signature":"vat_c1aTytSLVkPw9wWhven9GtLBSLFzJViIq5scLDA"
}
```
If we Base64 decode the `protected` member we get:
```json
{
  "alg":"HS256",
  "kid":"A81E5d4DwI"
}
```

The payload is the ClusterInfo JSON object as described above.  Astute readers will note that the actual root certificates are double Base64 encoded.  It is a good thing that efficiency isn’t critical here.

*Implementation Note:* there looks to be a decent library for dealing with JWS: https://github.com/square/go-jose.

#### Method: ClusterInfo refresh

The API server will serve up a version of this endpoint at `https://<address>/cluster-info/v1/` (note the `https`).  Assuming the user authenticates to (and verifies identity of) the API server, this returns the `ClusterInfo` object directly.  This is used by clients that already have communication with the cluster to update their cached copy of the ClusterInfo object.  It is expected that the client will respect the `expiredTime` member of the object and refresh before the information is expired if at all possible.  

Implementation note: We'll probably want to jitter this to avoid a stampede.

#### Future Method: DNSSEC
If we have a secure DNS method we can use that to distribute both the IP addresses of the cluster along with the root certificates to trust.  Other information can be encoded in TXT records.
