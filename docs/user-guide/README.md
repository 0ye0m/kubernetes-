# Kubernetes User Guide: Managing Applications

**Table of Contents**
<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: GENERATED_TOC -->
- [Kubernetes User Guide: Managing Applications](#kubernetes-user-guide:-managing-applications)
  - [Quick walkthrough](#quick-walkthrough)

The user guide is intended for anyone who wants to run programs and services on an existing Kubernetes cluster.  Setup and administration of a Kubernetes cluster is described in the [Cluster Admin Guide](../../docs/admin/README.md). The [Developer Guide](../../docs/devel/README.md) is for anyone wanting to either write code which directly accesses the kubernetes API, or to contribute directly to the kubernetes project.

Please ensure you have completed the [prerequisites for running examples from the user guide](prereqs.md).

## Quick walkthrough

1. [Kubernetes 101](walkthrough/README.md)
1. [Kubernetes 201](walkthrough/k8s201.md)

## Thorough walkthrough

If you don't have much familiarity with Kubernetes, we recommend you read the following sections in order:

1. [Quick start: launch and expose an application](quick-start.md)
1. [Configuring and launching containers: configuring common container parameters](configuring-containers.md)
1. [Deploying continuously running applications](deploying-applications.md)
1. [Connecting applications: exposing applications to clients and users](connecting-applications.md)
1. [Working with containers in production](production-pods.md)
1. [Managing deployments](managing-deployments.md)
1. [Application introspection and debugging](introspection-and-debugging.md)
    1. [Using the Kubernetes web user interface](ui.md)
    1. [Logging](logging.md)
    1. [Monitoring](monitoring.md)
    1. [Getting into containers via `exec`](getting-into-containers.md)
    1. [Connecting to containers via proxies](connecting-to-applications-proxy.md)
    1. [Connecting to containers via port forwarding](connecting-to-applications-port-forward.md)

## Concept guide

[**Overview**](overview.md)
: A brief overview of Kubernetes concepts.

[**Pod**](pods.md)
: A pod is a co-located group of containers and volumes.

[**Label**](labels.md)
: A label is a key/value pair that is attached to a resource, such as a pod, to convey a user-defined identifying attribute. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of resources.

[**Selector**](labels.md#label-selectors)
: A selector is an expression that matches labels in order to identify related resources, such as which pods are targeted by a load-balanced service.

[**Replication Controller**](replication-controller.md)
: A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. It both allows for easy scaling of replicated systems and handles re-creation of a pod when the machine it is on reboots or otherwise fails.

[**Service**](services.md)
: A service defines a set of pods and a means by which to access them, such as single stable IP address and corresponding DNS name.

[**Volume**](volumes.md)
: A volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to a Container as part of its filesystem.  Kubernetes volumes build upon [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/), adding provisioning of the volume directory and/or device.

[**Secret**](secrets.md)
: A secret stores sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, which can be made available to containers upon request.

[**Name**](identifiers.md)
: A user- or client-provided name for a resource.

[**Namespace**](namespaces.md)
: A namespace is like a prefix to the name of a resource. Namespaces help different projects, teams, or customers to share a cluster, such as by preventing name collisions between unrelated teams.

[**Annotation**](annotations.md)
: A key/value pair that can hold larger (compared to a label), and possibly not human-readable, data, intended to store non-identifying auxiliary data, especially data manipulated by tools and system extensions.  Efficient filtering by annotation values is not supported.
