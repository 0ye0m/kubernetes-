#Connecting to applications: kubectl proxy and apiserver proxy
You have seen the [basics](../../docs/accessing-the-cluster.md) about `kubectl proxy` and `apiserver proxy`. This guide shows how to use them together to access a service([kube-ui](../../docs/ui.md)) running on the Kubernetes cluster from your workstation.


##Getting the apiserver proxy URL of kube-ui
kube-ui is deployed as a cluster add-on. To find its apiserver proxy URL,
```
$ kubectl cluster-info | grep "KubeUI"
KubeUI is running at https://173.255.119.104/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-ui
```
if this command does not find the URL, try the steps [here](../../docs/ui.md#accessing-the-ui).


##Connecting to the kube-ui service from your local workstation
The above proxy URL is an access to the kube-ui service provided by the apiserver. To access it, you still need to authenticate to the apiserver. `kubectl proxy` can handle the authentication.
```
$ kubectl proxy --port=8001
Starting to serve on localhost:8001
```
Now you can access the kube-ui service on your local workstation at [http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-ui](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-ui)
