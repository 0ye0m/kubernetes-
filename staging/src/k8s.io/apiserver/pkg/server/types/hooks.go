// PostStartHookFunc is a function that is called after the server has started.
// It must properly handle cases like:
//  1. asynchronous start in multiple API server processes
//  2. conflicts between the different processes all trying to perform the same action
//  3. partially complete work (API server crashes while running your hook)
//  4. API server access **BEFORE** your hook has completed
// Think of it like a mini-controller that is super privileged and gets to run in-process
// If you use this feature, tag @deads2k on github who has promised to review code for anyone's PostStartHook
// until it becomes easier to use.
