package collector

type Interface interface {
	// Starts the collector process if necessary, e.g. when using the builtin cadvisor.
	// Otherwise, does nothing and just returns.
	Start() error

	// Returns the basic node spec, e.g. can be used to report to k8s master the
	// basic information about a node.
	NodeInfo() (*NodeInfo, error)

	// Returns the software version of various components of a node, e.g. can be
	// used to report back to k8s master the versions of relevant software on a node.
	VersionInfo() (*VersionInfo, error)

	// Returns the file system information of a given label or mount point (mount point
	// is represented in absolute path, i.e. starting with '/', and label is not), e.g.
	// can be used by kubelet to check if there's enough disk space to schedule new pods
	// and by the image manager to decide if garbage collection should start.
	FsInfo(fsLabel string) (*FsInfo, error)

	// Returns a channel for watching requested event types, e.g. can be
	// used by oom watcher to detect oom events.
	WatchEvents(request *EventRequest) (chan *Event, error)

	// Get raw metrics of a Docker container
	// containerID: Docker container ID
	// numStats: max number of metrics to return
	// start: start time to query the metrics data, and if omitted, the beginning of time is assumed
	// end: end time to query the metrics data, and if omitted, the current time is assumed
	// Returned value is a map of container name to its metrics data, and this data can be in a
	// collector-specific format, e.g. can be used to handle /stats/... REST calls
	DockerContainerInfo(containerID string, numStats int, start time.Time, end time.Time) (map[string]interface{}, error)

	// Get raw metrics of a Linux container
	// containerName: absolute path of a Linux container
	// numStats: max number of metrics to return
	// start: start time to query the metrics data, and if omitted, the beginning of time is assumed
	// end: end time to query the metrics data, and if omitted, the current time is assumed
	// subcontainer: if true, returns raw metrics information of this container and its child containers
	RawContainerInfo(containerName string, numStats int, start time.Time, end time.Time, subcontainers bool) (map[string]interface{}, error)

	// DockerContainerInfo() and RawContainerInfo() return collector-specific raw data, which need to be
	// parsed to retrieve a particular metric type, e.g. cpu, memory, cpu load, file system. The respective
	// parsing interface functions, e.g. GetContainerCPUInfo(), GetContainerMemoryInfo(), GetContainerNetworkInfo(),
	// etc., should be defined to retrieve such data in a format consumeable by Kubernetes. However, as of now
	// Kubernetes is currently not using any of such metrics data, thus, these interface functions (along with the
	// corresponding data structs) should be defined and tuned at the time when such code is added.
