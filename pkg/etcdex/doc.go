// Package etcdex provides a read-only "coherent" in-memory content-addressible cache of etcd content.
//
// It assumes that etcd is being according to the following extended analogy:
// Etcd concept                 : Relation Database Concept :: 
// 
// tree rooted at "dir"         : Table ::
// etcd file part after "dir"   : Primary Key ::
// etcd value (must be JSON)    : Row (except Primary Key) ::
// union of all fully qualified 
// JSON property names of etcd 
// values in "dir"              : Columns of a Table ::
//
// It provides for the creation of "indexes" of "tables" stored in etcd.
// The name is a contraction of etcd and index.
// It is not intended to be a completehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping
// It watches etcd to keep its indexes up to date.
